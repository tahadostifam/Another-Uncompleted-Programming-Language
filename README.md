# Cyrus Programming Language

Cyrus is a general-purpose, statically-typed, manually memory-managed programming language designed for performance-critical applications. It leverages **LLVM** as its compiler backend, providing efficient code generation and optimization capabilities. The language syntax is heavily influenced by C, offering familiarity to developers experienced with C-like languages.

## Target Audience

Cyrus is primarily aimed at experienced programmers who value performance, control, and low-level system interactions. Developers seeking to build high-performance applications that require precise memory management will find this language well-suited to their needs.
